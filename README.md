## Overview

### The challenge

My challenge is to build out this multi-page website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.1.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size âœ…
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page âœ…
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout âœ…
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout âœ…
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- Bonus: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (localStorage could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
